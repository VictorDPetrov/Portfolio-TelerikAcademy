                    - When we started 9th grade in person, The feeling & excitement for robotics were on 100%, until Covid-19 wave, came again. Then we were doing online schooling. In our free time we met in person & did our tasks for the competition. It was though, but we made it. And for 2-nd year, we didn't not participate in person. We finished in 3-rd place, in Division Premiere.
